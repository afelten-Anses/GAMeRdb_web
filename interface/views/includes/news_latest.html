<div class="active content"><!-- news content -->
    <p>We have debug the phylogeny tool. When more than 50 genomes was selected, some of them could not appear in the tree and matrix results. Now, none are forgotten!</p>
    <p>Global phylogeny for each pathogen is now accessible ! Due to the huge amout of genome for <i>Listeria monocytogenese</i> and <i>Salmonella enterica</i>, newick and matrix files are available but not show for this species. 
	You can donwload it and use viewer like <a href="https://itol.embl.de/" target="_blank">iTOL</a> or <a href="http://dendroscope.org/" target="_blank">Dendroscope</a> for the visualization.</p>
    <p>Resistance and Virulence genes found for each genome are added in the mongoDB database. Dynamic tabs will be developed soon! Right now, you can 
    retrieve results from "ABRicate" folders in the "GAMeR_DB" directory of the \\sas-vp-lsgw1 server.</p>
